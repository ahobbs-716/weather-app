Overall design:

My interviewees told me that they used weather apps in two primary situations: 
When making immediate decisions about the day ahead (what to wear, whether they needed to take hayfever tablets etc); and 
When making future decisions which depended on the weather (which day to host a party, whether to plan an indoor or outdoor activity etc).

My app focuses on the first case, as interviewees told me that this was a more common use case, and less well served by current weather apps.

My design is task-focused, focusing on the two most common decisions made by users:
Choosing clothing for the weather (based on temp range, precipitation)
Taking medication based on the weather 

It aims to fulfil the following design principles, requested by users: 
Simple and clean: users wanted to be able to interpret their app at a glance, and were prepared to sacrifice information in order to do this.
Take a position: users wanted the app to do as much work as possible when deciding e.g. whether it would rain, taking the burden off the user to interpret the information.

It will also aim to signpost CoolWeatherâ€™s other services e.g. the website.
